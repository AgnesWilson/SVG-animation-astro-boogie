# Astro Boogie Animation

This project is a playful SVG animation called Astro Boogie, featuring a cosmic dance of blinking stars and spinning orbits. The animation was created as part of an assignment in the course <em>Grafiska verktyg</em> at Medieinstitutet where we got to work with and experiment with SVG files and animations.

## Project Overview

The goal of this assignment was to:

- Create an SVG file using a design tool such as Illustrator, Inkscape, or Figma.
- Include non-standard fonts (not Arial, Helvetica, or Times New Roman), and convert the text into outlines to ensure consistent appearance across systems.
- Animate the SVG with features like rotation, color changes, or other creative effects.

Features of the Astro Boogie Animation:
- Stars scattered across the canvas blink by transitioning their opacity over time
- Spinning orbits changing colours with a yoyo effect, meaning that they are constantly transitioning between colours. 
- Sunbeams spinning around the center ang changing size 
- The word **Astro** scaling down, making it apear smaller and the word **Boogie** scaling up, making it appear lager. 

## Tools Used

Design: The entire deign of the Astro Boogie scene was created as an SVG file in Adobe Illustrotor 

Animation: GSAP is used to handle all animations snd some basic CSS is used for layout and styling.
